# **2. User Experience**

## **2.1 First Interaction**

### **2.1.1 Initial Touchpoint**

A new user lands on Sage‚Äôs interface. Instead of a complicated onboarding process, Sage immediately invites them to start either typing or speaking. No sign-up is required for the initial experience.

### **2.1.2 Onboarding Experience**

- The onboarding process is experiential rather than instructional, allowing users to learn by doing.
- Sage prompts the user: *"Tell me what‚Äôs on your mind today."*
- If the user hesitates, Sage provides a gentle nudge: *"You don‚Äôt have to filter yourself. Just speak or type whatever feels right."*

### **2.1.3 Why This Matters**

- Many users hesitate to journal because they feel pressured to write perfectly.
- Sage eliminates this friction by making the first interaction effortless.

## **2.2 Core Experience**

- If a user seeks guidance, Sage engages with structured reflection.
- If a user repeatedly discusses a particular concern, Sage surfaces insights related to recurring themes.

### **2.2.3 Behind-the-Scenes Processing**

1. User inputs a thought (text or voice).
2. Sage retrieves past context and memory from previous interactions.
3. Sage analyzes emotional patterns using embeddings and AI-driven reasoning.
4. Sage crafts a response that extends beyond mirroring words, guiding the user toward deeper reflection.

**The Feeling of Being Understood -** Sage retains context and past discussions, ensuring responses feel personalized rather than generic.

### **2.5.2 Progress Tracking Without Pressure**

Unlike traditional self-help applications that enforce daily journaling, Sage allows freeform input while still tracking meaningful trends.

### **2.5.3 Daily Insights as a Ritual**

Even if users do not journal daily, a concise, tailored reflection maintains engagement.

### **2.5.4 Pattern Recognition and ‚ÄúAha‚Äù Moments**

The core value of Sage is uncovering trends that users may not see themselves.

## **2.6 Design Principles**

- Users should never feel constrained by formatting or structure.
- Sage allows users to express themselves in whatever way feels most natural.
- Insights should feel natural and intuitive rather than mechanically generated.
- Sage adapts responses based on tone, mood, and past context.

# **3. Sage's Intelligence**

## **3.1 Core Principle**

Sage is not just a chatbot‚Äîit is an **adaptive intelligence** designed to mirror the way humans reflect on their own thoughts over time. Unlike traditional AI assistants that react to isolated inputs, Sage:

- **Remembers past interactions** and retrieves relevant context.
- **Recognizes patterns** across thoughts over time.
- **Offers insights that evolve** based on the user‚Äôs mental and emotional trends.
- **Adapts dynamically**‚Äînot just responding, but actively shaping conversations to guide deeper self-reflection.

## **3.2 The Three Layers**

Sage‚Äôs ability to remember, analyze, and respond intelligently is built on **three interconnected layers of memory and reasoning**:

| **Memory Layer** | **Purpose** | **Example of Use** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Short-Term Memory** | Keeps track of thoughts within a conversation. | Ensures continuity in an ongoing session. |
| **Long-Term Memory** | Recognizes recurring emotional & behavioral patterns over time. | ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve mentioned work stress often‚Äîdoes it connect to perfectionism?‚Äù |
| **Personality Model** | Adapts based on user tendencies, refining its approach. | If a user frequently expresses skepticism, Sage frames questions more neutrally. |

## **3.3 Emotional Intelligence**

### **3.3.1 Structured Thought Processing**

Every time a user shares a thought, Sage follows **a structured yet dynamic process.**

1. **Capturing Input:** Sage records the user‚Äôs thought (text or voice).
2. **Contextualizing the Thought:** Sage retrieves short-term memory from the current session and long-term memory from past experiences.
3. **Pattern Recognition & Emotional Mapping:** Sage identifies recurring themes using embeddings and structured memory.
4. **Generating an Adaptive Response:** Based on memory and reasoning, Sage formulates a response that **either validates, explores, or challenges the user‚Äôs thought.**

**Example:**

<aside>
üí°

> **User**
‚ÄúI feel like every time I try something new, I end up failing.‚Äù

***Sage‚Äôs Internal Process:***
> 
> - *Retrieves past user interactions related to ‚Äúfailure‚Äù and ‚Äútrying new things.‚Äù*
> - *Recognizes a recurring theme of **self-doubt in new experiences.***
> - *Assesses whether the user has previously found **ways to succeed in similar situations.***
>     
>     
>     **Sage**
>     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve mentioned this before‚Äîdo you think your fear of failure is stopping you from seeing progress?‚Äù OR ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a time you tried something new and it *did* work out?‚Äù
>     
</aside>

### **3.3.2 Multi-Layered Pattern Recognition**

Instead of just responding to inputs, Sage **analyzes emotions, themes, and recurring concerns** to **detect underlying trends.**

1. **Embedding-Based Pattern Matching**
    - Every user thought is **converted into a vector embedding** (a numerical representation of its meaning).
    - Similar thoughts are clustered together to detect **recurring emotional themes**.
2. **Graph-Based Memory:**
    - Explicit connections are mapped between key ideas (e.g., ‚ÄúFear of failure‚Äù linked to ‚ÄúSelf-worth‚Äù issues).
    - This allows Sage to understand the **relationships** between thoughts, not just similarities.
3. **Dynamic Insight Generation:**
    - If a pattern is detected (e.g., repeated stress about work), Sage surfaces insights in a **non-intrusive way.**

### **3.3.3 Self Reflection**

Instead of instantly responding, Sage takes a moment to **‚Äúreflect‚Äù internally** before formulating a reply.

- **It first checks past conversations** to retrieve relevant context.
- **It ‚Äúthinks out loud‚Äù internally** (i.e., generates internal reflections).
- **It then crafts a thoughtful response** that is more than just an answer‚Äîit‚Äôs a guide for deeper exploration.

**Example:**

<aside>
üí°

> **User**
*"I feel like I‚Äôm always making mistakes."

**Sage‚Äôs Internal Process***
> 
> - Checks past logs to see **if similar statements were made.**
> - Retrieves user tendencies (e.g., perfectionism vs. self-doubt).
> - Reflects internally: *"Is this a recurring issue, or a one-time frustration?"*
> 
> **Sage**
> 
> *"When you say 'always,' do you mean in a particular area of life? Or do you feel this way in general?" OR "I've noticed this thought has come up before‚Äîdo you think there's a deeper reason behind it?"*
> 
</aside>

### **3.3.4 Avoiding False Assumptions**

- Drawing false insights is worse than drawing no insights at all.
- Sage does **not manufacture insights** for the sake of engagement.
- If no strong pattern emerges, Sage acknowledges this.
- Users must **feel in control** over how Sage understands them.
- If an insight feels incorrect, users can adjust it.
